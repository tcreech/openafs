What's in the "doc" subdirectory

** doc/man-pages
pod sources for man pages (converted from original IBM html source).

** doc/xml
xml sources for manuals (converted from original IBM html source).
Note: The doc/xml/AdminRef uses doc/xml/AdminRef/pod2refentry to convert the
pod man pages to xml for printing.  pod goes directly to html just fine.

** doc/pdf
Old Transarc (and possibly pre-Transarc) protocol and API documentation for
which we have no other source.

** doc/txt
Technical notes, Windows notes, and examples.

** doc/doxygen
Configuration files for the doxygen tool to generate documentation from
the annotated sources. See the 'dox' Makefile target in the top level
Makefile.
